Object-oriented programming: A programming paradigm where programmers define custom data types that have custom methods embedded within them.



Object: An object is a custom data structure that organizes and encapsulates variables and methods into a single data type. It is used near-interchangeably with “instance.”

Class: A custom data type comprised of multiple variables and/or methods. Instances or objects are created based on the template provided by the class.

Note that because the term 'object' is often used to refer both to actual data structures and to the general paradigm of object-oriented programming, we'll typically stick to the terms 'class' and 'instance' instead.

Instance: A single set of values of a particular class. Classes may be comprised of multiple variables; an instance is a set of values for these variables. The term “instance” is often used interchangeably with the term “object”.
